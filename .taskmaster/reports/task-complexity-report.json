		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Development Environment",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: Next.js project initialization, TypeScript configuration, Tailwind CSS v4 setup, Shadcn/ui and Lucide React integration, Framer Motion and Zustand setup, Noto Sans KR font configuration, atomic design folder structure, ESLint/Prettier/dev scripts, and Git repository initialization with .gitignore.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple tool integrations, initial project structure, and enforcing code quality standards. Each integration (e.g., Tailwind, Shadcn/ui, Zustand) has unique configuration steps and potential pitfalls, but the process is well-documented and follows standard patterns for modern React/Next.js projects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Production Deployment and Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: CI/CD pipeline setup, production database configuration with backup/recovery, error tracking integration, performance monitoring with alerts, analytics setup, A/B testing framework, security monitoring, vulnerability scanning, environment health checks, auto-scaling configuration, and CDN optimization for Korea.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers a wide range of production concernsâ€”deployment automation, monitoring, analytics, security, and scaling. Each area requires specialized knowledge and careful configuration to ensure reliability and compliance, making this a highly complex, multi-disciplinary task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build Korean TTS Voice Coaching System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: Korean TTS service integration, script template creation, real-time audio synthesis, coaching intensity logic, encouragement message system, offline synthesis capability, and mobile audio optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating TTS with real-time feedback, Korean language nuances, and offline support introduces significant technical and UX complexity. Each feature (e.g., intensity levels, offline synthesis) requires distinct implementation and testing, especially for mobile optimization and accurate pronunciation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Mobile Optimization and Performance Features",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: touch interaction optimization, 60fps animation tuning, PWA setup, video lazy loading, mobile navigation, bundle/code splitting, service worker/offline support, touch gesture controls, memory usage optimization, and mobile error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Achieving high mobile performance and smooth UX involves deep optimization across UI, animation, network, and memory. Each aspect (e.g., 60fps, offline, gestures) is a specialized area, and their interplay increases overall complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Korean UI Foundation and Design System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: Noto Sans KR font integration, Korean typography settings, design token creation (colors, spacing, grid), responsive breakpoints, base component development, theme provider setup, and Korean text rendering adjustments.",
			"reasoning": "Building a robust design system with full Korean support and responsive design requires careful planning and implementation of typography, tokens, and components. Ensuring accessibility and WCAG compliance adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Backend Infrastructure with Node.js and PostgreSQL",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: Express server setup with TypeScript, PostgreSQL configuration, Redis setup, database schema design, migrations/seeders, environment config, CORS setup, and CRUD operation scaffolding.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves backend service setup, database design, and caching, each with its own best practices and configuration challenges. Ensuring secure, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure increases the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Ballet Movement Video Database",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: video schema design, metadata management UI, video upload system, tagging for AI, preview/thumbnail generation, Korean search functionality, video quality validation, and format encoding.",
			"reasoning": "Managing a large video database with rich metadata, search, and AI tagging requires careful schema design and robust upload/validation pipelines. Supporting Korean search and ensuring video quality adds further complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Progress Tracking and Analytics System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: class completion tracking, analytics dashboard, skill progression logic, progress reports (weekly/monthly), achievement system, personal best tracking, progress sharing, analytics integration, and recommendation engine.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive tracking and analytics require integrating multiple data sources, real-time updates, and user-facing dashboards. Implementing achievement logic and recommendations involves both backend and frontend complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create User Onboarding Flow with Skill Assessment",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: welcome screen, skill assessment form, goal setting UI, preference selection (focus/music), progress stepper, preference storage, and onboarding completion flow.",
			"reasoning": "While onboarding flows are common, supporting interactive skill assessment, multi-step navigation, and Korean localization adds moderate complexity. Each step requires distinct UI and backend integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create Class Playback and Video Player Interface",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: custom video player (vertical), seamless video transitions, music sync engine, voice coaching overlay, playback controls, progress tracking, class preview, adaptive video quality, offline download/playback, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Building a feature-rich video player with seamless transitions, music sync, voice overlay, and offline support is highly complex. Each feature (e.g., adaptive streaming, offline, overlays) is a significant engineering challenge, especially for mobile."
